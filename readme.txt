This folder consists of 6 files for phase 1:

1. input.txt -> It consists of the machine code in the formate: 0x0 0x00000093
                The first number represents PC value and the second one is the 
                instruction. It can be changes according to the requirement of 
                the user. Whatever written on it will be executed in the code.

2. Memory_file.txt -> It is showing our memory. The memory which is not written 
                      in the file is empty .It is also in the same formate that
                      of input file . The first value represents memory address.
                      And the second one is the value stored in that memeory. 
                      As the name suggests, the values are in hexadecimal.

3. phase1.cpp -> It is the c++ code of the simulator. After the code is executed,
                 number of cycles in each step ,total number of cycles and the 
                 description of each instruction are shown in the terminal.

4. readme.txt -> Explanation

5. register_file_dec -> Shows the values of 32 registers(in decimal) after the 
                        execution of the code.

6. register_file_hex -> Shows the values of 32 registers(in hexadecimal) after 
                        the execution of the code.

For phase 2, we have added some more files:

1. phase2.cpp -> C++ code of the simulator (updated version)

2. phase2_gui.py -> python code for phase2_gui

3. terminal.txt -> showing the operations performed in each cycle

4. output.txt -> giving basic information after running the code
